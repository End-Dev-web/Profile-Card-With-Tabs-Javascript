# Profile-Card-With-Tabs-Javascript
This tutorial shows how to create a Profile Card containing JavaScript-driven tabs. Each tab displays a separate chunk of content when clicked.  Tabs are ideal for singular page web apps or websites with multiple subjects to display. In this tutorial, we shall create a simple web application with a horizontal switchable tabs panel.  We will define the structure of the web application using HTML. Then render the elements on the screen using CSS and finally, add the functionality using some bit of Vanilla JavaScript. That's right, no fancy JavaScript framework is needed, just the simple Vanilla JavaScript we all know.
